# Pollen-Clustering-and-ANOVAs
This project compares a k-means and hierarchical clustering to expert-assigned classification of pollen data collected from Yellowstone National Park. We also conduct ANOVAs to determine whether there are any statistically significant differences between the means of vegetative species within 3 of these clustered groups.
